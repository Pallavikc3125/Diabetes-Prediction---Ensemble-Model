# Diabetes Prediction - Ensemble Model

The main objective is to predict whether the people in the dataset have diabetes. Because in this example we focused on improving the accuracy of our prediction, we used an ensemble method – Voting Classifier – to combine the results of the base models. Two of the base models we have used are also ensemble models (Random Forest and Adaptive Boosting). We have used two versions of Voting Classifiers – with and without weights.
